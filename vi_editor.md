To go to a specific line in the vi editor, you can use the following command:


:42


Type the colon (:) to enter command mode, followed by the line number (42), and then press Enter. The cursor will move to line 42.

Alternatively, you can also use the following shortcut:


42G


Type the line number (42) followed by the capital letter G. This will move the cursor to line 42 without having to enter command mode.
