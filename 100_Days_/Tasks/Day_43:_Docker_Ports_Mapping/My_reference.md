Task: Set up a Nginx container on Application Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter.

Step 1: Connect to Application Server 3

First, connect to Application Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter using SSH or any other remote access method.

Step 2: Pull the Nginx Docker image

Use the following command to pull the nginx:alpine-perl Docker image:

bash
docker pull nginx:alpine-perl

Let's break down the command:

- docker pull: This command is used to pull a Docker image from a registry (in this case, Docker Hub).
- nginx:alpine-perl: This is the name of the image to pull. The alpine-perl tag specifies a variant of the Nginx image that's based on Alpine Linux and includes Perl.

Step 3: Create and run the Nginx container

Use the following command to create and run a container named ecommerce using the nginx:alpine-perl image:

bash
docker run -d --name ecommerce -p 8082:80 nginx:alpine-perl

Let's break down the command:

- docker run: This command is used to create and run a new container from a Docker image.
- -d: This option runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
- --name ecommerce: This option specifies the name of the container to create.
- -p 8082:80: This option maps port 8082 on the host machine to port 80 in the container. This allows you to access the Nginx server running in the container by visiting http://localhost:8082 in your web browser.
- nginx:alpine-perl: This is the name of the image to use for the container.

Step 4: Verify the container

To verify that the container is running, use the following command:

bash
docker ps

This command lists all the running containers on the system. You should see the ecommerce container in the list.

You can also verify that Nginx is working by visiting http://localhost:8082 in your web browser. You should see the default Nginx welcome page.

Use case:

In this task, we're using Docker to deploy a Nginx web server in a container. The nginx:alpine-perl image provides a lightweight and efficient way to run Nginx, and the -p option allows us to map a host port to a container port, making it easy to access the Nginx server from outside the container.

By following these steps, you've successfully set up a Nginx container on Application Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter, and you've mapped port 8082 on the host machine to port 80 in the container. You can now use this container to host your application.
[02-Sep-25 11:43 AM] Meta AI: To verify that the port mapping is successful, you can use the following command:

bash
docker ps -a --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Ports}}"

This command will show you the container name and the port mappings.

Alternatively, you can use:

bash
docker port ecommerce

This command will show you the port mappings for the ecommerce container specifically.

You can also use:

bash
docker inspect -f '{{range $p, $conf := .NetworkSettings.Ports}}{{$p}} -> {{$conf.HostPort}}{{end}}' ecommerce

This command will show you the port mappings in a more detailed format.

If you want to verify from outside the container, you can use:

bash
curl http://localhost:8082

If the port mapping is successful, you should see the Nginx welcome page.

You can also use netstat or ss command to verify if the port is listening:

bash
netstat -tlnp | grep 8082

or

bash
ss -tlnp | grep 8082

These commands will show you if the port 8082 is listening and which process is using it.
[02-Sep-25 11:46 AM] Meta AI: Let's break it down:

Map host port 8082 to container port 80:

Imagine you're at a big office building with many rooms. Each room has its own phone number, but the phone numbers are not accessible from outside the building. To receive calls from outside, you need to map the external phone number to the internal room phone number.

In this case:

- Host port 8082 is like the external phone number (8082) that people can call from outside.
- Container port 80 is like the internal room phone number (80) that only works within the building (container).

Mapping means creating a connection between the external phone number (8082) and the internal room phone number (80). When someone calls the external phone number (8082), it will ring the internal room phone number (80).

Keep the container in running state:

This means that the container (room) should be active and ready to receive calls (requests) through the mapped port (8082).

Real-life example:

Let's say you're running a web server (Nginx) inside a container. The web server is listening on port 80 (container port 80). You want to access the web server from outside the container. To do this, you map the host port 8082 to the container port 80.

Now, when you visit http://localhost:8082 in your web browser, the request is forwarded to the container's port 80, where the web server is listening. The web server responds, and you see the website in your browser.

In summary:

- Host port 8082 is the external entry point.
- Container port 80 is the internal service (web server) that's listening for requests.
- Mapping the ports allows external requests to reach the internal service.

By keeping the container in a running state, you ensure that the web server is active and can respond to requests coming through the mapped port.
[02-Sep-25 11:51 AM] Meta AI: In Docker, port mapping is typically done when you run a container using the -p or --publish flag. This flag allows you to map a container port to a host port.

If you have an existing container and you want to map a port, you can use the docker run command with the -p flag, but you'll need to recreate the container.

However, if you want to map a port to an existing container without recreating it, you can't do it directly. You'll need to use other approaches like:

1. Create a new container with the port mapping and migrate the application.
2. Use Docker Compose and update the docker-compose.yml file to include the port mapping, then recreate the container.

But if you're asking about a separate task or command specifically for port mapping, there isn't a direct one. Port mapping is typically done as part of the container creation process.

That being said, you can use the docker port command to inspect the port mappings of a container, or use docker inspect to get more detailed information about the container's network settings, including port mappings.
[02-Sep-25 11:53 AM] Meta AI: The docker port command is used to display the public-facing port(s) that are mapped to a container's private port(s).

Syntax:

bash
docker port CONTAINER [PRIVATE_PORT[/PROTO]]

Example:

bash
docker port ecommerce

This command will display the port mappings for the ecommerce container, showing which host ports are mapped to which container ports.

If you specify a private port, it will show you the corresponding host port:

bash
docker port ecommerce 80

This command will display the host port that is mapped to container port 80 for the ecommerce container.

The docker port command is useful for:

- Verifying port mappings
- Checking which host port is mapped to a specific container port
- Troubleshooting network connectivity issues

Note that the docker port command only shows the port mappings for running containers. If the container is stopped, you won't see any port mappings.
[03-Sep-25 9:48 AM] Meta AI: In the command docker run -d, the -d flag stands for "detached".

When you run a container with the -d flag, it starts the container in the background and doesn't block your terminal. The container runs in detached mode, allowing you to continue using your terminal for other commands.

In other words, -d allows you to run a container in the background, freeing up your terminal for other tasks.

You can also use the longer form --detach instead of -d, like this:

bash
docker run --detach ...

Both -d and --detach achieve the same result: running the container in detached mode.
