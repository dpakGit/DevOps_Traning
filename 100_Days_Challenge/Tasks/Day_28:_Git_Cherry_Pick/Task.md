### Task:

The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository /opt/cluster.git. This repo is cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC. They recently shared the following requirements with the DevOps team:

There are two branches in this repository, master and feature. One of the developers is working on the feature branch and their work is still in progress, however they want to merge one of the commits from the feature branch to the master branch, the message for the commit that needs to be merged into master is Update info.txt. Accomplish this task for them, also remember to push your changes eventually.

------------------------------------------------

### What I Did

```
thor@jumphost ~$ ssh natasha@ststor01   

[natasha@ststor01 ~]$ sudo -s

[root@ststor01 natasha]# cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/

[root@ststor01 kodekloudrepos]# ls -alh
total 12K
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4.0K Aug 23 12:45 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4.0K Aug 23 12:45 ..
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4.0K Aug 23 12:45 cluster

[root@ststor01 kodekloudrepos]# cd cluster/

[root@ststor01 cluster]# ls -alh

total 20K
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4.0K Aug 23 12:45 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4.0K Aug 23 12:45 ..
drwxr-xr-x 8 root root 4.0K Aug 23 12:45 .git
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   35 Aug 23 12:45 info.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   17 Aug 23 12:45 welcome.txt

Note: *Operations Should Be in cluster Directory*
- Context: cluster is the Git repository.
- Reason: To perform Git operations (like cherry-pick, push), you must be inside the repo (cluster).
- Path: /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster.

[root@ststor01 cluster]# git status
On branch feature
nothing to commit, working tree clean

[root@ststor01 cluster]# git branch

* feature

  master

[root@ststor01 cluster]# git log

Note: Exiting Git Log Page
- Method: Press q (for quit).
- Context: git log uses a pager (like less) to show output.
- Result: Pressing q exits the log view and returns to terminal.


[root@ststor01 cluster]# git log --oneline

334ac19 (HEAD -> feature, origin/feature) Update welcome.txt

730d227 Update info.txt

f2d0fec (origin/master, master) Add welcome.txt

316efdd initial commit

[root@ststor01 cluster]# git log feature --oneline

334ac19 (HEAD -> feature, origin/feature) Update welcome.txt
730d227 Update info.txt
f2d0fec (origin/master, master) Add welcome.txt
316efdd initial commit


Note: *Command: git log feature --oneline*

- Effect: Shows commit history of feature branch in one-line format.

- Output: Compact view with commit hashes and messages.

Example Output
abc123 Update info.txt
def456 Add new feature code
ghi789 Initial commit on feature


Note: *Running git log feature --oneline*

- Branch requirement: Doesn't matter which branch you're on.

- Effect: Shows commit history of feature branch in one-line format regardless of current branch.

Reason
- git log <branch> views history of specified branch.
- Current checked-out branch doesn't affect this.

[root@ststor01 cluster]# git branch
* feature
  master

[root@ststor01 cluster]#  git checkout master

Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

[root@ststor01 cluster]# git branch
  feature
* master

Note: This is crucial â€” cherry-picking applies the commit to the currently checked-out branch.

[root@ststor01 cluster]# git cherry-pick 730d227
