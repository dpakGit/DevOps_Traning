[24-Aug-25 10:49 PM] Meta AI: *Choosing git add Command*
- Context: You want to stage changes in story-index.txt.
- Options:
- git add story-index.txt: Stages just this file.
- *git add .*: Stages all changes in the repo.

Recommendation
- Since you're fixing just story-index.txt, use:

bash
git add story-index.txt


Do you need help with:
- *Understanding git add usage*?
- Staging changes in Git?
- Something else related to Git?

error: src refspec main does not match any.
error: failed to push some refs to 'http://git.stratos.xfusioncorp.com/sarah/story-blog.git'
[24-Aug-25 10:50 PM] Meta AI: Error Explanation
- Error: src refspec main does not match any.
- Cause: Likely the branch is not main, maybe master or another name.

Steps to Fix
1. Check branch name.

bash
git branch

- See what branch you're on (e.g., master).

2. Push to correct branch.

bash
git push origin <branch-name>
# Example if on 'master':
git push origin master


Do you need help with:
- Finding the right branch name in Git?
- Pushing to a specific branch?
- Something else related to Git?

hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do

hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
[24-Aug-25 10:58 PM] Meta AI: Error Explanation
- Error: Push rejected because remote has changes you don't have locally.
- Cause: Someone else (maybe Sarah) pushed to master since you last synced.

Steps to Fix
1. Pull remote changes.

bash
git pull origin master
# Resolve any merge conflicts if prompted


2. Push again.

bash
git push origin master


Do you need help with:
- Resolving Git push rejections due to remote changes?

Username for 'http://git.stratos.xfusioncorp.com': max
Password for 'http://max@git.stratos.xfusioncorp.com': 
To http://git.stratos.xfusioncorp.com/sarah/story-blog.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'http://git.stratos.xfusioncorp.com/sarah/story-blog.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
[24-Aug-25 10:59 PM] Meta AI: Error Explanation
- Error: Push rejected because local branch is behind remote master.
- Cause: Remote master has commits not in your local master.

Steps to Fix
1. Pull remote changes.

bash
git pull origin master
# Resolve any merge conflicts if prompted


2. Push again.

bash
git push origin master


Alternative: Force Push (Caution)
- If you want to overwrite remote (risk losing others' changes):

bash
git push origin master --force-with-lease


Do you need help with:
- Handling Git push rejections due to being behind?
- *Using git pull to sync with remote*?
- Something else related to Git?
[24-Aug-25 11:00 PM] Deepak Ranjan Mishra: git pull origin master
error: Pull is not possible because you have unmerged files.
hint: Fix them up in the work tree, and then use 'git add/rm <file>'

fatal: Exiting because of an unresolved conflict.
[24-Aug-25 11:00 PM] Meta AI: Error Explanation
- Error: Pull blocked due to unmerged files (conflicts).

git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"


4. Push again.

bash
git push origin master
