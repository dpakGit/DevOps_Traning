*Creating Temporary User ammar on App Server 2*
To create a temporary user ammar with an expiry date on App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter:

Steps:
1. Connect to App Server 2: SSH into App Server 2 using ssh username@<IP_of_App_Server_2>, replacing <IP_of_App_Server_2> with the actual IP address.
2. *Create user ammar with expiry date*:

bash
sudo useradd -e 2024-02-17 ammar

-e 2024-02-17 sets the account expiry date to February 17, 2024.

*Meaning of -e*
In the useradd command, *-e stands for "expire"*.

Context
- *-e <date>*: Sets the account expiry date for the user.
- Format for the date is typically YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2024-02-17).


3. Verify user creation and expiry:

bash
sudo chage -l ammar

- This shows account expiry information for ammar.

4. Exit SSH session: Use exit to return to the original user.

Notes
- Ensure the username ammar is in lowercase as required.
- You need a valid username, IP address of App Server 2, and credentials to SSH into App Server 2.

Do you need help with executing these steps, managing user accounts, or something else regarding App Server 2?
