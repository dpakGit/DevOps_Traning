### Task:
The Nautilus DevOps team is working to create new images per requirements shared by the development team. One of the team members is working to create a Dockerfile on App Server 3 in Stratos DC. While working on it she ran into issues in which the docker build is failing and displaying errors. Look into the issue and fix it to build an image as per details mentioned below:

a. The Dockerfile is placed on App Server 3 under /opt/docker directory.

b. Fix the issues with this file and make sure it is able to build the image.

c. Do not change base image, any other valid configuration within Dockerfile, or any of the data been used — for example, index.html.

Note: Please note that once you click on FINISH button all existing images, the containers will be destroyed and new image will be built from your Dockerfile.

---------------------------------------------------------

### What is the Task and how to accomplish it

### Task: Fix a Dockerfile on App Server 3 in Stratos DC to build a Docker image successfully.

Given details:

- The Dockerfile is located in the /opt/docker directory on App Server 3.
- The base image, other configurations, and data (e.g., index.html) should not be changed.

Steps to accomplish the task:

1. Investigate the issue:
    - Check the Dockerfile for any syntax errors or potential issues.
    - Run the docker build command to see the error messages:

bash
cd /opt/docker
docker build -t my-image .

- Analyze the error messages to identify the problem.

2. Fix the issues:
    - Based on the error messages, fix the issues in the Dockerfile. Common issues might include:
        - Incorrect syntax or formatting.
        - Missing or incorrect dependencies.
        - Inaccessible files or directories.
    - Make sure to only fix the issues and do not change the base image or other valid configurations.

3. Verify the Dockerfile:
    - Once you've fixed the issues, verify that the Dockerfile is correct and should build the image successfully.
    - You can use the docker build command again to test the Dockerfile:

bash
docker build -t my-image .


4. Build the image:
- If the Dockerfile is correct, build the image using the docker build command:

bash
docker build -t my-image .

- This command will create a Docker image with the name my-image.

Commands and their use cases:

- cd /opt/docker: Changes the directory to /opt/docker, where the Dockerfile is located.
- docker build -t my-image .: Builds a Docker image using the Dockerfile in the current directory and tags it with the name my-image.
- docker build: This command is used to build Docker images from a Dockerfile.

### Important tips and best practices:

- Always verify the Dockerfile syntax and formatting before building the image.
- Use the docker build command with the -t flag to specify a tag for the image.
- Make sure to test the Dockerfile and image after making changes to ensure they work as expected.

By following these steps and commands, you should be able to fix the issues with the Dockerfile and build a Docker image successfully.

###  What is the error message and what to do

The error message indicates that the sed command in the Dockerfile is trying to modify a file that doesn't exist:

bash
sed: can't read /usr/local/apache2/conf.d/httpd.conf: No such file or directory

The issue seems to be with the path to the httpd.conf file. The correct path might be different.

Looking at the Dockerfile, the line causing the issue is:

RUN sed -i "s/Listen 80/Listen 8080/g" /usr/local/apache2/conf.d/httpd.conf

Given the base image is httpd:2.4.43, the httpd.conf file is likely located at /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf.

Try updating the Dockerfile to use the correct path:

RUN sed -i "s/Listen 80/Listen 8080/g" /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf

Also, check the next sed command in the Dockerfile and update its path accordingly:

RUN sed -i '/LoadModule\ ssl_module modules\/mod_ssl.so/s/^#//g' /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf

Make these changes and try running the docker build command again:

bash
docker build -t myimage:1 .

- The httpd.conf file is not located in /usr/local/apache2/conf.d/, but rather in /usr/local/apache2/conf/.

- If you're still having issues with the Dockerfile, you might want to verify the location of the httpd.conf file in the httpd:2.4.43 image. You can do this by running a container from the image and checking the file system:

bash
docker run -it httpd:2.4.43 /bin/bash

- This will give you a shell prompt inside the container, where you can navigate the file system and find the location of the httpd.conf file.



### To locate the file path of httpd.conf in a running container or in a Docker image, you can use the following command:

bash
docker run -it httpd:2.4.43 /bin/bash -c "find / -name httpd.conf"

This command will search for the httpd.conf file starting from the root directory (/) and print the path(s) where the file is found.


Alternatively, you can also use:

bash
docker run -it httpd:2.4.43 /bin/bash

And then inside the container, run:

bash
find / -name httpd.conf

This will give you an interactive shell where you can explore the file system and find the httpd.conf file.

In the case of the httpd:2.4.43 image, the httpd.conf file is likely located at /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf.


- After you know the location of the httpd.conf file, you can update your Dockerfile to use the correct path. For example, if you want to modify the httpd.conf file to change the port from 80 to 8080, you can use:

RUN sed -i "s/Listen 80/Listen 8080/g" /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf

- The /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf file is the active configuration file used by Apache.

- When you make changes to the Apache configuration, you typically want to modify the active configuration file, which is /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf.

So, in your Dockerfile, you can use:

RUN sed -i "s/Listen 80/Listen 8080/g" /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.con

### Here are the commands to locate the httpd.conf file inside the container:

1. Find command:

bash
find / -name httpd.conf

This command searches for files named httpd.conf starting from the root directory (/) and prints the path(s) where the file is found.

2. Locate command (if the locate database is updated):

bash
locate httpd.conf

However, the locate command might not work if the database is not updated or if the file is not indexed.

3. Ls command (if you know the likely directory):

bash
ls /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf

or

bash
ls /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

This command checks if the file exists in a specific directory. You can modify the path based on your knowledge of the container's file system.

You can run these commands inside the container using:

bash
docker run -it httpd:2.4.43 bash

And then execute the command(s) you prefer.

- Note the above is not what we want as it states to change the configuration to change after the container is created, although it is correct our case is to modify the Dockerfile itself.


[root@stapp03 ~]# docker run -it httpd:2.4.43 bash
root@da8e8f65ce95:/usr/local/apache2#  #


In the output of the command what is /usr/local/apache2

- When you run the command:

bash
docker run -it httpd:2.4.43 bash

You are starting a new container from the httpd:2.4.43 image and running a bash shell inside it.

The /usr/local/apache2 is the working directory inside the container. This is because the httpd:2.4.43 image is configured to set the working directory to /usr/local/apache2 by default.

You can verify this by checking the WORKDIR instruction in the Dockerfile for the httpd:2.4.43 image. However, in this case, it's likely that the httpd process is designed to run from this directory, and it contains the necessary files and configuration for the Apache server.

When you see the prompt:

bash
root@da8e8f65ce95:/usr/local/apache2#

It indicates that you are currently in the /usr/local/apache2 directory inside the container.

- You should replace the existing paths in your Dockerfile with /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf to match the actual location of the httpd.conf file in the httpd:2.4.43 image.

Specifically, you should update the RUN commands that modify the httpd.conf file to use the correct path:

RUN sed -i "s/Listen 80/Listen 8080/g" /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf

And any other RUN commands that reference the httpd.conf file should also be updated to use the correct path.

By doing so, you should be able to successfully build your Docker image and run the Apache server with the desired configuration.



Based on the standard directory structure of the httpd:2.4.43 image, it seems that the httpd.conf file is actually located at /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf, not /usr/local/apache2/conf.d/httpd.conf.

To fix the Dockerfile, you should update the paths to reference the correct location of the httpd.conf file. Here's the updated Dockerfile:


###  Modified Dockerfile
```
FROM httpd:2.4.43

RUN sed -i "s/Listen 80/Listen 8080/g" /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf

RUN sed -i '/LoadModule\ ssl_module modules\/mod_ssl.so/s/^#//g' /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf


RUN sed -i '/LoadModule\ socache_shmcb_module modules\/mod_socache_shmcb.so/s/^#//g' /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf

- Note : The output of the docker inspect command shows various details about the image, including:

- Config: Configuration settings for the image, such as environment variables, exposed ports, and the command to run when the container starts.

- WorkingDir: The working directory inside the container, which is /usr/local/apache2. This confirms what we previously discovered.


#### Note: Read the Dockerfile very carefully to find out errors and mistakes.

- The issue here is that you're using the ADD instruction incorrectly. ADD is used to copy files from the local directory into the Docker image, whereas you're trying to use it to run sed commands.

- To run commands during the Docker build process, you should use the RUN instruction.

- Also updated the path in the sed commands to /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf.

- Modified Dockerfile is exactly same as the above

```
