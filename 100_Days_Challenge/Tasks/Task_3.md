### Task : Day 3: Secure Root SSH Access

#### Following security audits, the xFusionCorp Industries security team has rolled out new protocols, including the restriction of direct root SSH login.

#### Your task is to disable direct SSH root login on all app servers within the Stratos Datacenter.

#### Solution:

**What i Did**
```
 1.ssh steve@172.16.238.11 

[steve@stapp02 ~]$ 

 1. sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config # by using vi editor and going inside the file i made the changes or you can follow the bello command
    
 2.sudo sed -i 's/PermitRootLogin yes/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config # Changing the permission from the command line itself

 3.sudo systemctl restart sshd # This is a must command otherwise the changes will not be implemented

 4.sudo grep PermitRootLogin /etc/ssh/sshd_config # To Check/Verify wheteher the Permission has changed or not

 5.history | cut -c 8-
```
I did the same thing for the first three users tony, steve and banner then the task was marked completed .

#### 1. Verifying and Disabling Root Login on App Server 1
To ensure 'root' login is disabled on the Server:

Steps:
1. SSH into App Server 1: ssh username@<App_Server_1_IP>
2. Check SSH config:

bash
sudo grep PermitRootLogin /etc/ssh/sshd_config

- If the output is PermitRootLogin yes, then root login is still enabled.

3. Edit SSH config if necessary:

bash
sudo nano/vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    - Change PermitRootLogin yes to PermitRootLogin no.
    - Save and exit the editor.

4. Restart SSH service:

bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd

5. Verify again:

bash
sudo grep PermitRootLogin /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    - Output should be PermitRootLogin no.

Notes
- Ensure you have sudo privileges on the Server.
- Test by attempting to SSH as root to verify login is disabled.
```
Testing SSH as Root to Verify Login is Disabled
To test if root login is disabled via SSH:

Command:

bash
ssh root@<server_IP>

- Replace <server_IP> with the actual IP address of the server (e.g., 172.16.238.14).

Expected Outcome:
- If root login is disabled, you should see a message like:

Permission denied, please try again.

or

Access denied

- If you successfully log in, then root login is still enabled, and you need to revisit the PermitRootLogin no configuration.

Notes
- Ensure you're testing from a different user session to avoid locking yourself out if you're making changes remotely.
- This test verifies the effectiveness of the PermitRootLogin no configuration.

Do you need help with SSH testing, server access, or something else regarding this verification?
```


#### Changing PermitRootLogin to "no" without Nano or Vi directly from the terminal
To change PermitRootLogin yes to PermitRootLogin no without using nano or vi, you can use the sed command:

Command:

bash
sudo sed -i 's/PermitRootLogin yes/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config

- -i option edits the file in-place.
- s/old/new/ substitutes "old" with "new" (in this case, PermitRootLogin yes with PermitRootLogin no).

Followed by:

bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd

- Restarts the SSH service to apply the changes.

Notes
- Ensure you have sudo privileges.
- This method is useful for automating changes or when you prefer command-line only interactions.

#### 2. Disabling Direct Root SSH Login on App Servers
To disable direct SSH root login on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter:

Steps for Each App Server:
1. Connect to the app server: SSH into the app server using ssh username@<app_server_IP>.
2. Edit SSH configuration:

bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    - Find the line PermitRootLogin yes and change it to:

bash
PermitRootLogin no

    - Save and exit the editor (in nano, press Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).
3. Restart SSH service:

bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd

4. Exit SSH session: Use exit to return to the original user.

Notes
- This needs to be done on each app server in Stratos Datacenter.
- Ensure you have a valid username with sudo privileges to make these changes.
- Verify after making changes that root login is disabled by attempting to SSH as root.

#### 3. Disabling Direct Root SSH Login on Multiple App Servers

To disable direct root SSH login on multiple app servers efficiently:

Method 1: Manual SSH for Each Server
Repeat the steps for each app server:
1. SSH into each app server: ssh username@<app_server_IP>
2. Edit SSH config: sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config, change PermitRootLogin yes to PermitRootLogin no.
3. Restart SSH service: sudo systemctl restart sshd
4. Exit: exit

Method 2: Using a Script or Ansible
For multiple servers, automation tools like Ansible or a simple script can save time.

Example Script (assuming you have SSH access and sudo privileges):

bash
#!/bin/bash
**# List of app server IPs**
servers=("192.168.1.1" "192.168.1.2" "192.168.1.3")

for server in "${servers[@]}"; do
  ssh -t username@$server "sudo sed -i 's/PermitRootLogin yes/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config && sudo systemctl restart sshd"
done

- Replace username with your actual username.
- Replace servers array with the IPs of your app servers.

Using Ansible (if configured):

---
- name: Disable root SSH login
  hosts: app_servers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Update sshd_config
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        regexp: '^PermitRootLogin yes'
        line: 'PermitRootLogin no'
        state: present
      notify: Restart sshd

  handlers:
    - name: Restart sshd
      service:
        name: sshd
        state: restarted

- Ensure your Ansible inventory (hosts file) has the group app_servers defined with your app server IPs.

Notes
- SSH access and sudo privileges are required.
- Test the changes on one server before applying to multiple servers.

#### 4. Handling Different Usernames on Multiple App Servers or if Usenames are different;

If usernames are different across app servers, the approach needs adjustment:

Method 1: Manual SSH with Different Usernames
For manual method, you'll need to know the username for each app server:
1. SSH into each app server: ssh username1@<app_server1_IP>
2. Edit SSH config: sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config, change PermitRootLogin yes to PermitRootLogin no.
3. Restart SSH service: sudo systemctl restart sshd
4. Exit: exit

Repeat for each server with its respective username.

Method 2: Scripting with Different Usernames
Modify the script to include usernames for each server:

bash
#!/bin/bash
**#List of app server IPs and corresponding usernames**
servers=("username1@192.168.1.1" "username2@192.168.1.2" "username3@192.168.1.3")

for server in "${servers[@]}"; do
  ssh -t $server "sudo sed -i 's/PermitRootLogin yes/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config && sudo systemctl restart sshd"
done

- Replace usernameX with the actual username for each app server.

Method 3: Ansible with Different Usernames
In Ansible, you can specify different usernames for each host in your inventory file:

[app_servers]
app_server1 ansible_host=192.168.1.1 ansible_user=username1
app_server2 ansible_host=192.168.1.2 ansible_user=username2
app_server3 ansible_host=192.168.1.3 ansible_user=username3

Then use the same Ansible playbook as before.

Notes
- Credentials (passwords or SSH keys) should be set up for each username.
- Test connectivity and privileges before running the playbook or script.

#### Where to run the above Script in Method 2
To run the script in Method 2, you'll need to use a terminal or command line interface on a machine that has SSH access to the app servers:

Steps:
1. Open a terminal on your local machine or a server that has SSH access to the app servers.
2. Create a new script file:

bash
nano disable_root_ssh.sh

3. Paste the script into this file:

bash
#!/bin/bash
**List of app server IPs and corresponding usernames**
servers=("username1@192.168.1.1" "username2@192.168.1.2" "username3@192.168.1.3")

for server in "${servers[@]}"; do
  ssh -t $server "sudo sed -i 's/PermitRootLogin yes/PermitRootLogin no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config && sudo systemctl restart sshd"
done

4. Save and exit the editor (in nano, press Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).
5. Make the script executable:

bash
chmod +x disable_root_ssh.sh

6. Run the script:

bash
./disable_root_ssh.sh


Notes
- Ensure you have SSH access to the app servers from the machine where you're running the script.
- Test the script on a single server before running it on multiple servers.
- You may be prompted for sudo passwords for each server if SSH keys are not set up.
