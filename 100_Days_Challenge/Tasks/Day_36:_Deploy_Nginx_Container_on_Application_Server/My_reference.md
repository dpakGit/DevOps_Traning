### Ensuring Container is Running
- *Check if the container nginx_2 is running*:

bash
docker ps | grep nginx_2

- Output will show the running container if it's in a running state.

If Container is Not Running
- Start the container if it's stopped:

bash
docker start nginx_2


Do you need help with:
- Troubleshooting Docker container issues?
- Managing Docker containers (stop, start, restart)?
- Something else related to Docker or containers?
