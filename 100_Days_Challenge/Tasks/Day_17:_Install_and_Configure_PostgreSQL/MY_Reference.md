#### PostgreSQL Classification

PostgreSQL is a database management system (DBMS). Specifically, it's a relational database management system (RDBMS).

- Database aspect: PostgreSQL manages databases, which store data in structured formats like tables.
- Not an application: PostgreSQL itself isn't an end-user application like a word processor or web browser. Instead, it's a system for managing databases, and users interact with it via tools like psql, GUIs, or through applications that connect to it.

Usecase
PostgreSQL is used by applications for storing, managing, and retrieving data.

Do you need help with:
- Using PostgreSQL with an application?
- PostgreSQL queries and commands?
- PostgreSQL administration?


#### Creating a Database in PostgreSQL
Yes, inside PostgreSQL (the database management system), you can create databases.

- PostgreSQL can manage multiple databases.
- Each database can have its own tables, users, permissions, etc..
- You create databases using SQL commands like CREATE DATABASE or via GUI tools.

Example
As we did in the earlier task:
- We created a database named kodekloud_db4 in PostgreSQL.

Do you need help with:
- Creating tables in a PostgreSQL database?
- Managing PostgreSQL users and permissions?
- Querying data in PostgreSQL?


 #### PostgreSQL Commands
Yes,
- *CREATE USER WITH PASSWORD*: is a PostgreSQL command to create a user with a password.
- *CREATE DATABASE*: is a PostgreSQL command to create a database.
- *GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES*: is a PostgreSQL command to grant permissions to a user on a database.

Purpose
These SQL commands are used to manage users, databases, and permissions within PostgreSQL.

Do you need help with:
- Other PostgreSQL commands?
- Understanding PostgreSQL syntax?
- Using PostgreSQL for an application?
