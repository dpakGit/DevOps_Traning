### Task:

One of the Nautilus developer was working to test new changes on a container. He wants to keep a backup of his changes to the container. A new request has been raised for the DevOps team to create a new image from this container. Below are more details about it:

a. Create an image news:devops on Application Server 1 from a container ubuntu_latest that is running on same server.

### What I Did

```
Here's an improved version:

"It's done! Here's what I did:

I started by checking the Docker images and containers:


bash
[root@stapp02 steve]# docker images
REPOSITORY   TAG     IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
ubuntu       latest  e0f16e6366fe  4 weeks ago   78.1MB

[root@stapp02 steve]# docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE    COMMAND      CREATED       STATUS           PORTS  NAMES
fd0cdefd3239  ubuntu   "/bin/bash"  58 seconds ago  Up 56 seconds         ubuntu_latest


Note that the container ubuntu_latest was in the "Up" state this time, unlike earlier when it was in the "Created" state.

I then committed the container to create a new image:


bash
[root@stapp02 steve]# docker commit ubuntu_latest cluster:nautilus
sha256:95607532f9b57aae3ed1948b4101c933d08028fa7b365d47d0b7c077f40f44ba


After committing, I verified the container status and the new image:


bash
[root@stapp02 steve]# docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE    COMMAND      CREATED       STATUS           PORTS  NAMES
fd0cdefd3239  ubuntu   "/bin/bash"  3 minutes ago  Up 3 minutes         ubuntu_latest

[root@stapp02 steve]# docker images
REPOSITORY   TAG     IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
cluster      nautilus 95607532f9b5  32 seconds ago  131MB
ubuntu       latest  e0f16e6366fe  4 weeks ago   78.1MB


The new image cluster:nautilus was successfully created!"
```
### See what went wrong earlier
#### # Note: This time the status is "Up 56 seconds" as compared to earlier one which was "Created"

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.
