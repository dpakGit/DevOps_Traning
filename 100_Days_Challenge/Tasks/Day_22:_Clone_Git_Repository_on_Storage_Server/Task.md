### Task :

Explain the following task clearly and very elaborately - The DevOps team established a new Git repository last week, which remains unused at present. However, the Nautilus application development team now requires a copy of this repository on the Storage Server in the Stratos DC. Follow the provided details to clone the repository:



The repository to be cloned is located at /opt/media.git


Clone this Git repository to the /usr/src/kodekloudrepos directory. Ensure no modifications are made to the repository during the cloning process.

### What I Did
```
thor@jumphost ~$ ssh natasha@172.16.238.15

# Navigate to the destination directory and there apply the git clone command 

cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos

sudo git clone /usr/src/kodekloudrepos

OR , Directly apply

sudo git clone /opt/media.git /usr/src/kodekloudrepos

# Post-Clone Checks (Optional) - Check clone contents:

ls /usr/src/kodekloudrepos

ls -l /usr/src/kodekloudrepos

ls -alh /usr/src/kodekloudrepos
```



*No Output from git clone when the commnad ls /usr/src/kodekloudrepos was ran*
- If git clone /opt/media.git /usr/src/kodekloudrepos gave no output:
- Git might have succeeded silently if there were no issues.
- Check if the clone happened:

bash
ls /usr/src/kodekloudrepos

- Expected result: You should see files from the repo (if any were in /opt/media.git).

Possible Reasons for No Output
- If /opt/media.git is empty (no commits/files), the clone is still "successful" but with no files.

Do you need help with:
- *Checking if the clone worked in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos*?
- Understanding Git output (or lack of) in clones?
- Something else related to this Git clone task?


*Output of ls -l /usr/src/kodekloudrepos*
- Result: total 0 indicates the directory is empty.
- Possible reasons:
- /opt/media.git was empty (no commits/files).
- Clone still created the target directory /usr/src/kodekloudrepos but it's empty.

Checking Git Repo Status
- Check if Git repo metadata is there:

bash
ls -la /usr/src/kodekloudrepos

- You should see a .git directory if the clone worked.

Do you need help with:
- Understanding why /opt/media.git might be empty?
- Creating initial commits/files in /opt/media.git?
- Something else related to this Git clone task?

Note: *Output of ls -alh /usr/src/kodekloudrepos*
- Result:
- total 12K: Shows directory contents.
- .git directory is present.
- Means:
- The clone was successful.
- /usr/src/kodekloudrepos is a Git repository (with .git folder).
- But the working directory is empty (no files besides .git).

Do you need help with:
- *Working with the cloned Git repo in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos*?
- Adding files/commits to /opt/media.git (the original bare repo)?
- Something else related to this Git setup?
