**Error**
It seems like you're experiencing a syntax error.

The correct syntax for your code should be:
```
age = 25
if age > 20:
    print(age)
```
Make sure to:

1. Use a consistent number of spaces for indentation (4 spaces is standard).
2. Ensure the colon (:) is present after the if statement.
3. Verify there are no typos or missing characters.

If you're still encountering issues, please provide the exact error message you're receiving.


Q. Why we should provide a space ,after the if statement , when writing the print command ?

Sol:
In Python, the space after the if statement (and the colon :) is called indentation. It's not just a matter of style; it's actually a requirement for Python syntax.

Here's why:

1. Block-level structure: Python uses indentation to denote block-level structure. In other words, it helps the interpreter understand which lines of code belong together as a group.
2. Grouping statements: When you use indentation, you're telling Python that the indented lines are part of the same group. In this case, the print statement is part of the if statement's group.
3. Avoiding ambiguity: Without indentation, Python wouldn't know whether the print statement belongs to the if statement or not. Indentation removes this ambiguity.

If you don't provide the space (or indentation), you'll get a SyntaxError. Python expects the indented block to start on the next line after the if statement.

So, to summarize: the space after the if statement is not just a stylistic choice; it's a necessary part of Python's syntax to define block-level structure and avoid ambiguity.


Q. Explain the following code- 

```
age =int(input("Enter Your Age: "))
if age >=18:
    print(age >=18)```
```
Sol:
Let's break down the code:

Code Explanation
1. *age = int(input("Enter Your Age: "))*
- input("Enter Your Age: "): This line prompts the user to enter their age. The input() function returns a string containing the user's input.
- int(...): This converts the user's input (a string) to an integer. If the user enters a non-numeric value, this will raise a ValueError.
- age = ...: The result of the conversion (an integer) is assigned to the variable age.

2. *if age >= 18:*
- if: This begins a conditional statement.
- age >= 18: This is the condition being checked. It's a boolean expression that evaluates to True if age is greater than or equal to 18, and False otherwise.
- :: This colon marks the beginning of the block of code that will be executed if the condition is True.

3. *print(age >= 18)*
- print(...): This prints the result of the expression inside the parentheses.
- age >= 18: This is the same boolean expression as in the if statement. Since we're inside the if block, we know that this expression is True.
- So, this line will print True if the user's age is 18 or older.

In summary, this code:

1. Asks the user to enter their age.
2. Converts the input to an integer and stores it in the age variable.
3. Checks if the user's age is 18 or older.
4. If the user's age is 18 or older, prints True.

Q. Explain the following line and its output - 


```if age >=18:```


Also explain how python interprets its output and executes the next line of code ?


Sol:
Let's break down the line:

if age >= 18:

This line is a conditional statement that checks whether the value of age is greater than or equal to 18.

Here's how Python interprets it:

1. Evaluation: Python evaluates the expression age >= 18. This expression is a comparison between the value of age and the integer 18.
2. Boolean result: The comparison yields a boolean result, which is either True or False.
3. Conditional check: Python checks the boolean result. If it's True, the code inside the if block is executed. If it's False, the code inside the if block is skipped.

Now, let's talk about the output:

The if statement itself doesn't produce any output. Its purpose is to control the flow of the program based on the condition.

However, if the condition is True, the code inside the if block will be executed, and any output produced by that code will be displayed.

In your original code:

if age >= 18: print(age >= 18)

If the condition is True, the print statement will be executed, and it will print True.

Here's how Python executes the next line of code:

1. Conditional check: Python checks the boolean result of the condition.
2. Branching: If the condition is True, Python executes the code inside the if block. If the condition is False, Python skips the code inside the if block.
3. Next line: After executing the code inside the if block (if the condition is True) or skipping it (if the condition is False), Python moves on to the next line of code.

In your case, since there's no explicit else clause or additional code after the if block, Python will simply terminate the program after executing the if block (if the condition is True) or skipping it (if the condition is False).


Q. My Question:- "So literally **python checks the Boolean result** using the if condition and and with the help of the if condition it decides whether to execute the block insides it or not."

You've got it!

Python's if statement works exactly as you described:

1. Python evaluates the condition (e.g., age >= 18) and produces a boolean result (True or False).
2. The if statement checks this boolean result.
3. Based on the boolean result, Python decides whether to execute the code block inside the if statement or skip it.

Think of it like a fork in the road. Python evaluates the condition, and if it's True, Python takes the path to execute the code inside the if block. If it's False, Python takes the other path and skips the code inside the if block.

Your summary is spot on!
