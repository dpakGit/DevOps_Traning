# Explanation of the Code

This program provides a simple calculator functionality, allowing users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and average calculation.

**Program Structure**

The program consists of two main sections:

1. **Arithmetic Operations Functions:**

   This section defines five functions, each corresponding to a specific arithmetic operation:
   
    - add(num1, num2): Returns the sum of two numbers.
    - sub(num1, num2): Returns the difference of two numbers.
    - multiply(num1, num2): Returns the product of two numbers.
    - division(num1, num2): Returns the quotient of two numbers.
    - avg(num1, num2): Returns the average of two numbers.
      
3. **Main Program:**

   This section takes user input, displays a menu of available operations, and performs the chosen operation.


**Program Flow**

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the program's flow:

1. The program first defines the arithmetic operations functions.

2. In the main program section, the user is prompted to enter two numbers, Number_1 and Number_2.

3. A menu of available operations is displayed, and the user is asked to choose an operation by entering a corresponding number between 1 to 5.

4. Based on the user's choice, the program performs the corresponding arithmetic operation using the input numbers.

5. The result of the operation is then printed to the console.

6. If the user enters an invalid operation choice, an error message is displayed.

Example Use Cases

- User enters Number_1 = 10 and Number_2 = 5, and chooses operation 1 (addition).
- The program outputs: The sum of two numbers 10 and 5 is: 15.

- User enters Number_1 = 20 and Number_2 = 4, and chooses operation 4 (division).
- The program outputs: The division of two numbers 20 and 4 is: 5.0.
