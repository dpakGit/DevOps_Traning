# "Create a Python program that takes input for a student's name and their marks in three subjects, calculates the total percentage score, and outputs the student's name along with their total percentage score."

```
# My code

Name = input("Student Name : - ")
sub1 = input("Marks secured in sub-1: = ")
sub2 = input("Marks secured in sub-2: = ")
sub3 = input("Marks secured in sub-3: = ")
Total_Marks = 300
Total = int(sub1) + int(sub2) + int(sub3)
percentage = (Total/Total_Marks) * 100
# print(f"Name of the student is {Name} and Percentage of marks secured by him/her is {percentage} %")

print(f"Name of the student is {Name} \nPercentage of marks secured by him/her is {percentage} %")
