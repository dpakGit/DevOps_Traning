**Parameters and Arguments**


**Parameters**

Parameters are the variables listed inside the parentheses in the function definition. They act like placeholders for the data the function can accept when we call them.

Think of parameters as the blueprint that outlines what kind of information the function expects to receive.

def print_age(age):  # age is a parameter
    print(age)
In this example, the print_age() function takes age as its input. However, at this stage, the actual value is not specified.

The age parameter is just a placeholder waiting for a specific value to be provided when the function is called.
