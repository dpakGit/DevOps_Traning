[16-Aug-25 6:09 PM] Meta AI: Setting Up Static Websites on App Server 3
To accomplish the task of hosting two static websites on app server 3 in Stratos Datacenter:

a. Install httpd package and dependencies on app server 3

bash
# Install Apache (httpd) on app server 3
sudo yum install httpd -y


b. Configure Apache to serve on port 8083
- Edit Apache config to listen on port 8083:

bash
# Edit /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
sudo sed -i 's/Listen 80/Listen 8083/g' /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

- Start and enable Apache:

bash
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd


c. Set up websites using backups on jump_host
- Copy website backups from jump_host to app server 3 (assuming you have access):

bash
# Copy backups to app server 3 (run on jump_host or transfer via scp)
scp -r /home/thor/official app_server_3:/var/www/html/official
scp -r /home/thor/demo app_server_3:/var/www/html/demo

- Ensure Apache config allows access to these directories for URLs /official and /demo.

d. Verify access using curl
- On app server 3, test with:

bash
curl http://localhost:8083/official/
curl http://localhost:8083/demo/

You should see content from the respective websites.

Do you need help with:
- Configuring Apache for custom document roots?
- Testing website accessibility from outside localhost?
- Further Apache configuration or troubleshooting?
[16-Aug-25 6:16 PM] Meta AI: Setting Up Websites Using Backups on jump_host
No, you shouldn't perform the setup of websites on the jump_host itself for this task.

Instead
- Copy backups from jump_host: Transfer the website backups (/home/thor/official and /home/thor/demo) from the jump_host to the app server 3.
- Setup on app server 3: Configure Apache on app server 3 to serve these websites on http://localhost:8083/official/ and http://localhost:8083/demo/.

How to copy
You can use scp from the jump_host to copy backups to app server 3:

bash
# Run on jump_host
scp -r /home/thor/official app_server_3:/var/www/html/official
scp -r /home/thor/demo app_server_3:/var/www/html/demo

- *Completing the file transfer with scp*?
[16-Aug-25 6:40 PM] Meta AI: *What the scp Command Does*
The command:

bash
scp -r /home/thor/official 172.16.238.12:/var/www/html/official

is doing the following:

Breakdown
- *scp*: Secure Copy protocol for securely transferring files between hosts.
- *-r*: Recursively copy the entire directory and its contents.
- */home/thor/official*: Source directory on the local machine (jump_host).
- 172.16.238.12:/var/www/html/official: Destination on the remote server (172.16.238.12), placing files in /var/www/html/official.

Effect
This command copies the entire official directory and its contents from /home/thor/ on the jump_host to /var/www/html/official on the server 172.16.238.12.

Do you need help with:
- *Understanding scp options*?
- *Troubleshooting scp transfers*?
- Verifying files on the destination server?
[16-Aug-25 6:41 PM] Meta AI: Specifying Destination Directory
No, you don't necessarily need to remove the official in the destination path.

How it works
- If you specify 172.16.238.12:/var/www/html/official, the contents of /home/thor/official on the source will be copied into /var/www/html/official on the destination.
- If /var/www/html/official doesn't exist on the destination, the command will still work, copying the source directory official into /var/www/html/.

Alternative
You could use:

bash
scp -r /home/thor/official/* 172.16.238.12:/var/www/html/official/

to copy the contents of official directly into /var/www/html/official on the destination.

Do you need help with:
- *Understanding scp path behavior*?
- Verifying files on the destination server?
- Further file transfer configuration?
[16-Aug-25 6:42 PM] Meta AI: *What is * in the Command*
In the command:

bash
scp -r /home/thor/official/* 172.16.238.12:/var/www/html/official/

the * is a wildcard character.

Meaning
- * matches all files and subdirectories within the /home/thor/official/ directory.
- Using * here means you're copying the contents of official into /var/www/html/official on the destination.

Effect
This command copies all files and folders inside /home/thor/official/ to /var/www/html/official/ on 172.16.238.12, but doesn't copy the official directory itself.

Do you need help with:
- Understanding wildcards in commands?
