For a file named Docs.md, here are some suggestions for additional file name components and font styles:

Additional File Name Components:
1. Version number: Docs_v1.0.md or Docs_v2.md
2. Date: Docs_2023-02-20.md or Docs_20230220.md
3. Author/Contributor: Docs_JohnDoe.md or Docs_JD.md
4. Category/Topic: Docs_API.md or Docs_UserGuide.md
5. Format/Type: DocsMarkdown.md or Docs_Readme.md

Font Styles:
Here are some font styles you can use for your Docs.md file:

1. Bold: Surround text with double asterisks **Docs**.md
2. Italic: Surround text with single asterisks *Docs*.md
3. Strikethrough: Surround text with tilde characters ~Docs~.md
4. Code: Surround text with backticks `` Docs .md
5. Header: Use the # symbol followed by a space # Docs.md

Some examples of file names incorporating these font styles:

- **Docs**_API.md
- *Docs*_UserGuide.md
- ~Docs~_Archive.md
- `` Docs _v1.0.md
- # Docs.md (header style)

Here's a comparison of the two:

- docs_git.md:
    - Follows the conventional naming style of using lowercase letters.
    - Easy to read and understand.
    - Consistent with common naming conventions in software development.
- Docs_git.md:
    - Uses a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters (PascalCase).
    - Still easy to read and understand.
    - May be more noticeable or attention-grabbing due to the capital "D".

Both names are acceptable, but docs_git.md is more consistent with conventional naming styles.

If you're looking for a compromise between the two, you could use:

- Docs-Git.md (using a hyphen instead of an underscore)
- docs-Git.md (using a lowercase "d" and an uppercase "G")

Ultimately, the choice depends on your personal preference or project-specific naming conventions.


## Docs - Merge Conflict

Q. Consider a scenario where a new branch is created, and a new commit is made on the main branch. When the feature branch is later merged into the main branch, a merge conflict arises. This raises the question: does merging a branch into main always result in a conflict whenever new commits have been made to main?
