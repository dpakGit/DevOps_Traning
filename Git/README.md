... as described in [_Modules_](/terraform/language/modules).



```
kubectl get node 
```

```shell
terraform apply -var-file="testing.tfvars"
```




```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```

```html
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
  </div>
</div>
```



```
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        |      Are      |  Cool |
| ------------- | :-----------: | ----: |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |   $12 |
| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less      | Pretty     |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| _Still_  | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1        | 2         | 3          |

```


```
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
  </div>
</div>
```

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```
