The git status command checks the following:

1. Staged changes: Files that have been modified, added, or deleted and are staged (added to the index) for the next commit.
2. Unstaged changes: Files that have been modified, added, or deleted but are not staged for the next commit.
3. Untracked files: Files that are not being tracked by Git (i.e., not added to the repository).
4. Branch information: The current branch and whether it's up-to-date with the remote branch.
5. Commit status: Whether there are any changes to commit.

When you run git status, Git checks the following areas:

1. Working Directory (WD): The files and folders on your local machine.
2. Index (Staging Area): The area where changes are staged before being committed.
3. Repository (Local): The local Git repository, which contains all committed changes.

By checking these areas, git status provides a comprehensive overview of your repository's state, helping you manage your changes and commits efficiently!

```
git status # first command 
```
output:

On branch main

Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

Meaning of the above output:

Let's break down the output:

"On branch main":

- You are currently on the main branch of your local Git repository.

"Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'":

- Your local main branch is synchronized with the remote main branch (origin/main).
- You have the latest changes from the remote repository.

"nothing to commit":

- There are no changes in your local repository that need to be committed.
- Your local repository is in a clean state, with no modified or new files that require a commit.

"working tree clean":

- Your working directory (the files and folders on your local machine) is clean and matches the latest committed state.
- There are no modified, deleted, or untracked files in your working directory.

In summary, this output indicates that:

1. You're on the main branch.
2. Your local branch is up-to-date with the remote branch.
3. You have no local changes to commit.
4. Your working directory is clean and matches the latest committed state.

This is a great state to be in, as it means your local repository is fully synchronized with the remote repository, and you're ready to start working on new changes!
